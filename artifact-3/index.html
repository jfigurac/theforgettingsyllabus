                <p>Turbo Genesis was a censored comic book series during Martial Law in the island. The artifact is a set of carbon copies of a single page from issue five of the said title. The artifact is recovered from the now rubbles of Calimut Science High School. The banned title was about resistance and rebellion. I believe that an unidentified student of the school may have clandestinely reproduced and distributed these copies to pass down to the student population. Perhaps even selling them.
